## Season 1: Subprime Medical Practice

Last PR: v0.0.0.0   8-Apr-19

This is more or less a brain dump of ideas that I wanted to put into endgame just because why not. More or less just using this as a way to touch base on whatever mechanic I find handy atm.

I wouldn't really call it an expansion just yet. It might be your cup of tea. It might not. Can't please everyone.

## Additions
> The only thing separating a man from his death is his tools and his application of them.

 * AVM Toolset -> Lightweight mid to lategame replacement for the toolbox and a viable substitute to the Integrated Toolset.
 * New Materials -> Future research into metal binding on the molecular level has resulted in the creation of XE-Steel, a tougher lightweight material to replace common metals.
 * New Fuel Type -> Serving as the fuel source for most AVM grade machinery is reactive powder, a high powered energy source utilizing the reconstructive and enhancing capability of XE037.

## Planned
> We can only view the past as though we are looking forward.
  * Armor and Clothing -> New late-game clothing that goes beyond survivor gear, which can later be combined to form a full fitting power armor.
  * New Overmap Specials -> As you plunge deeper into the heart of New England, remnants of pre-cataclysm documents will be strewn about. Find them and assemble the map to the Aver Medical Research facility.
  * New Melee Weapons -> When knee deep in the dead, the only thing separating a survivor from their untimely (and inevitable) demise is their mind, and their tools. When that fails, best they start swinging.
  * New Ranged Weapons -> The AVM series of weaponry provides the common survivor with the means to further weaponize pneumatics, resulting in a far superior bolt driver, rivalling lesser plasmids and other conventional firearms.
  * New Comestibles -> While working on condensing metallic material, one scientist had the bright idea of attempting to combine food items into a unified food source. Though he is most likely more longer with us, his research bore fruit in the form of the **calorie tablet**.
  * New Classes -> The Cataclysm sent the majority of AVM installations into disarray once the communications network went down. You may have been one of the people there for ground zero.
  * New Enemies -> Many lives were lost during ground zero. Whether destroyed from within or from XE037, most officants took it upon themselves to make a living. A survivor may encounter them in their travels wandering about.
  * New Factions -> Rumor has it that survivors of ground zero are still holed up in certain AVM facilities, forming a society around the technology that still works. Some believe that the research into XE037 should be cultivated and taken advantage of. Others disagree.
  * New Mutation Trees -> At the bottom level of the AVM research facility is the Subprime portal. Those whom went in rarely came back. But those that did returned different from the others. Some had darker skin, others became shorter. A few had additional.. parts.
