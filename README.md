This is more or less a brain dump of ideas that I wanted to put into endgame just because why not.

I wouldn't really call it an expansion just yet. It might be your cup of tea. It might not. Can't please everyone.

## Additions
> The only thing separating a man from his death is his tools and his application of them.

 * AVM Toolset -> Lightweight mid to lategame replacement for the toolbox and a viable substitute to the Integrated Toolset.
 * Armor and Clothing -> New late-game clothing that goes beyond survivor gear, which can later be combined to form a full fitting power armor.

## Planned
> We can only view the past as though we are looking forward.
  
  * New Overmap Specials -> As you plunge deeper into the heart of New England, remnants of pre-cataclysm documents will be strewn about. Find them and assemble the map to the Aver Medical Research facility. 
  
  
 *unfinished more to come.*
